		<div class="about"><p>You know how some people will do ANYTHING for money? Or a taco....or whatever?  Well, replace money or a taco with DNA / genealogical research. That is me!  And I am NOT kidding.  I was lucky enough to be surrounded with SEVERAL adoptees in my life who wanted to track down their biological relatives AND once I started "the hunt" I was hooked.  In 2012 I had my DNA done (sorry Ancestry, the kit I was given was from 23andme.)  and then I FORCED my parents (WHO I ALREADY KNEW I WAS RELATED TO) to complete their DNA.  After that, I studied all kinds of ways to help people. I joined NAMus and looked into cold cases near me. I assisted friends, neighbors, and even complete strangers online in understanding their DNA.   I TRULY enjoy the monotonous hours involved in getting the answers.  I absolutely believe I could be an asset to your company even if it isn't with this specific position.  I hope you consider my resume because I say the words "ancestry" or "DNA"  every single day in one form or another and quite frankly, the people around me are quite tired of hearing about  it.</p>
